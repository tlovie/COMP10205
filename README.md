# Marking  Breakdown
- 6 Assignments -> 30% (5% each)
- 6 Quizzes -> 5% (1% each top 5)
- 1 Midterm Exam -> 30%
- 1 Final Exam -> 35% <br/>
The proctored component of this course will be conducted on paper - no computers will be required or allowed.  You need to achieve a passing grade on the proctored component to allow the assignments to count towards your final grade.
The assignments must include a statement of authorship.  Failure to include statement of authorship could result in a grade of zero with no opportunity to resubmit.

# Academic Integrity
[Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.mohawkcollege.ca/about-mohawk/leadership-and-administration/policies-and-procedures/corporate-policies-and-19) </br>
Use of AI tools such as ChatGPT is strongly discouraged.  Although my personal opinion is that ChatGPT could be a useful tool in the world outside of college education, it will not help you to learn the concepts covered in this course.  ChatGPT will not be a resource available for the exams.

# Course Topics

### Topics
- Arrays
- Searching
- Sorting
- Measuring Algorithm Performance
- Hashing
- Objects in Collections

Is this course an extension of the Java programming course - not really.  These concepts trancend programming languages and should become programming concepts that stand independent of programming language.

# How To Succeed In Our Class
- Come to class!
- Get comfortable with programming environment and experiment with the concepts - test things out on your own.  
- Complete the weekly exercises
- Read modules before classes
