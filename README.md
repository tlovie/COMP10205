# Academic Integrity
[Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.mohawkcollege.ca/about-mohawk/leadership-and-administration/policies-and-procedures/corporate-policies-and-19) </br>
Use of AI tools such as ChatGPT is strongly discouraged.  Although my personal opinion is that ChatGPT could be a useful tool in the world outside of college education, it will not help you to learn the concepts covered in this course.  ChatGPT will not be a resource available for the exams.
